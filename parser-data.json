The export sales gas must meet several strict specifications such as the concentrations of solids particle, water, mercury, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Two absorber vessels were installed at OGP to remove the H2S concentration of untreated gas. These absorber vessels are designed to run for months/years without any fouling. However, since operating in 2020, these vessels have been having fouling issues, which requires each absorber vessel to be opened and mechanically cleaned every 12 \u201315 days.",

    "node_4": "Key questions: What were the differences in operational data that resulted in the two dream runs in Dec 2021? And how do we replicate it forthe going-forward operation? This could potentially be answered by the application of ML based on the time series data of pressure, temperature,Note: The real-time data at OGP are measured by the local device/gauges then transmitted to the AVEVA PI system for data storage, visualisation and simple analysis. The AVEVA PI system is very commonly used in industrial operations in Australia and over the world. Therefore, the quality, format and structure of the data are expected to be good quality for machine learning purposes.",
