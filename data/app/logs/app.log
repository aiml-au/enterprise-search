2024-09-02 20:05:12,743 - [INFO] - Metric Reason: The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses strategic planning for the City of Adelaide, the second node mentions strategic actions and key performance indicators, and the third node talks about managing community assets and infrastructure, all of which do not address the objective of the proposed framework in the paper.

2024-09-02 20:05:40,504 - [INFO] - Metric Reason: The score is 0.00 because the context is about the City of Adelaide's Strategic Plan, including plans like the 'Dog and Cat Management Plan', which is not related to the primary objective of the proposed framework in the paper.

2024-09-02 20:05:50,141 - [INFO] - Metric Reason: The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics unrelated to the input question. For example, the first node focuses on community asset management and development projects, which is not relevant to how users provide exemplars of actions they want to count.
