2024-09-01 14:32:41,038 - [INFO] - Actual Output: Based on the context information, it can be inferred that the Orbost Gas Plant experienced a "dream run" in December 2021, which is characterized by very minimal deposition of sulphur. This suggests that the plant operated optimally during this period.
