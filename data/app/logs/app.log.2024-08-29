Since the query is "hard", I'm assuming it's related to the Long Term Financial Plan or the City of Adelaide's Strategic Plan. However, without more specific information, my answer will be a general response that might not directly address the query.

Here's my take:

The City of Adelaide's Long Term Financial Plan seems to prioritize financial sustainability, ensuring alignment with strategic plans, and investing in infrastructure development. The plan also aims to maintain a balanced budget, manage debt, and allocate funds for various initiatives.

In this context, I'd say that achieving a "hard" (i.e., challenging) goal might require careful planning, effective decision-making, and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the City of Adelaide's financial sustainability and growth.

Howling also helps to call pack members to a specific location. Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory, as shown in a dominant wolf&apos;s tendency to respond to a human imitation of a "rival" wolf in an area the wolf considers its own.
