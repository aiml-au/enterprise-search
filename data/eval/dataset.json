        "node_9": "Financial\nFinancial Principles\nTo deliver on our priorities and ensure financial \nsustainability for current and future generations, the \nbelow Financial Principles have been applied:\nCouncil will:\n\u2022 Continue to deliver current services and assets, \nindexed in line with Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\u2022 Apply fees and charges that are equitable and \nresponsive to changing community needs\n\u2022 Ensure an effective rating system \n\u2022 Maintain an operating surplus \n\u2022 Capitalise on external funding opportunities \nthrough retiming projects to align to stakeholder \nobjectives, recognising the potential need for \nincreased borrowings in order to respond \nto\u00a0opportunities \n\u2022 Consider new and different revenue streams to \nreduce reliance on existing revenue sources \n\u2022 Adjust rate revenue after consideration of all other \nbudget components and use growth in rate \nrevenue to partly fund servicing new rateable \nproperties and to service new borrowings\n\u2022 Fund new or enhanced services, assets or \nmaintenance requiring an increase in operating \ncosts from the adjustment of priorities, rate \nrevenue or other revenue increases and/or \nthrough\u00a0savings \n\u2022 Base all capital renewal expenditure on our asset \nmanagement plans \n\u2022 Consider the disposal, purchase and/or repurposing \nof property assets to support community \noutcomes, without incurring a financial loss \n\u2022 Use borrowings to fund new and upgrade projects \nwhere appropriate (which include major projects) \n\u2022 Ideally, fund operations, expenses or renewal \nprojects from within the budget.When considering these principles, Council considers \nthe service or project in the context of\u00a0Council\u2019s:\n\u2022 Roles and responsibilities;\n\u2022 Statutory obligations;\n\u2022 Ability to give effect to an adopted strategy, policy \nor plan;\n\u2022 Levers and discretion to intervene to address \nmarket challenges, opportunities or failure; or\n\u2022 Ability to gain value, efficiency or effectiveness in \nrelation to dollars spent.\nCouncil\u2019s Financial Principles ensure that Council\u2019s \nmeasures and targets can be met over the \nlonger\u00a0term. \nFinancial Sustainability\nThe Council\u2018s financial resources have the capacity to \nabsorb cyclical economic factors, social trends and \nfinancial shocks. Funding decisions are an important \nmethod of providing the capacity to meet financial \nsustainability in the medium and long term, along \nwith planning, stability of revenue and costs, \nproportionality of revenues with benefits over time \nand a \u2018balanced\u2019 operating result.\nFinancial sustainability is also central to supporting \nintergenerational equity (or fairness), which ensures \nthat the costs associated with expenditure are spread \nover time relevant to the communities that will draw \nbenefit. Council\u2019s Long Term Financial Plan has \nassumed that existing service levels will be \nmaintained, while seeking efficiency improvements in \nline with appropriate planning, measures \nand\u00a0benchmarks.\nResource Plan 2024  \u20132028\nCouncil has developed a Resource Plan which \nunderpins this Plan. It outlines the financial and \nnon-financial resources required to achieve our \nstrategic objectives over the next four years. The \nStrategic Plan and the Resource Plan will work in \nconcert with the Long-Term Financial Plan, Asset \nManagement Plans and City Plan to inform the \nAnnual Business Plan and Budget. Council\u2019s decision \nmaking is informed by strategies, plans and policies \nthat articulate the provision of services, programs \nand projects. Program Plans ensure all work is \nplanned and delivered in a coordinated way.The role of a Capital City Council is diverse and \ncomplex, which impacts the way we deliver services. \nWe are a leader, a service provider, a regulator, an \nowner, a facilitator and an advocate. By measuring \nthe delivery of our objectives and key actions, our \ncommunity will know what we have achieved. \nTargets provide further direction to ensure we are \ndelivering on our vision for the future, while allowing \nCouncil to measure and track progress through \nquarterly reports and an Annual Report each year.\n27 26\nCity of Adelaide | Strategic Plan 2024 \u20132028"
