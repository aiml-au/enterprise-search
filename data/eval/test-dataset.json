Firstly, supervised learning algorithms such as regression models or decision trees could be used to identify patterns and correlations between the operational data and the minimal sulphur deposition during the two dream runs in December 2021. Secondly, unsupervised learning methods like clustering could be used to group similar operational conditions together and identify the conditions that led to minimal sulphur deposition. Lastly, reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the operational conditions for minimal sulphur deposition. These strategies would involve training the models on historical data, testing their performance, and then using them to predict and replicate the optimal conditions.",

However, it is suggested that these differences could be related to the time series data of pressure, temperature, flowrate, and injection rate of the related equipment in the process at OGP. Machine learning can be applied to this data for future operations by training a model on this data to identify patterns and correlations that led to the successful runs. This model can then be used to predict the optimal operational parameters for preventing fouling issues in the future. The AVEVA PI system, which is used for data storage, visualisation and simple analysis, is expected to provide good quality data for this purpose.",

The export sales gas must meet several strict specifications such as t he concentrations of \nsolids particle, water, mercury, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide (H2S).   Two absorber vessels were installed at OGP to remove the H2S concentration of \nuntreated gas. These absorber vessels are designed to run for months/years without any fouling. However, since operating in 2 020 , these vessels \nhave been having fouling issues, which requires each absorber vessel to be opened and mechanically cleaned every 12 – 15 days. \n• Key  questions: What were the differences in operational data that resulted in the two dream runs in Dec 2021? And how do we replicate it for\nthe going -forward operation? This could potentially be answered by the application of ML based on the time series data of pressure, temperature, \nflowrate, injection rate… of the related equipment in the process at OGP. \n• Note: The real -time data at OGP are measured by the local device/gauges then transmitted to the AVEVA PI system for data storage, visualisation and \nsimple analysis.",
