Funding decisions are an important \nmethod of providing the capacity to meet financial \nsustainability in the medium and long term, along \nwith planning, stability of revenue and costs, \nproportionality of revenues with benefits over time \nand a ‘balanced’ operating result.\nFinancial sustainability is also central to supporting \nintergenerational equity (or fairness), which ensures \nthat the costs associated with expenditure are spread \nover time relevant to the communities that will draw \nbenefit. Council’s Long Term Financial Plan has \nassumed that existing service levels will be \nmaintained, while seeking efficiency improvements in \nline with appropriate planning, measures \nand benchmarks.\nResource Plan 2024  –2028\nCouncil has developed a Resource Plan which \nunderpins this Plan. It outlines the financial and \nnon-financial resources required to achieve our \nstrategic objectives over the next four years. The \nStrategic Plan and the Resource Plan will work in \nconcert with the Long-Term Financial Plan, Asset \nManagement Plans and City Plan to inform the \nAnnual Business Plan and Budget. Council’s decision \nmaking is informed by strategies, plans and policies \nthat articulate the provision of services, programs \nand projects. Program Plans ensure all work is \nplanned and delivered in a coordinated way.The role of a Capital City Council is diverse and \ncomplex, which impacts the way we deliver services. \nWe are a leader, a service provider, a regulator, an \nowner, a facilitator and an advocate. By measuring \nthe delivery of our objectives and key actions, our \ncommunity will know what we have achieved. \nTargets provide further direction to ensure we are \ndelivering on our vision for the future, while allowing \nCouncil to measure and track progress through \nquarterly reports and an Annual Report each year.\n27 26\nCity of Adelaide | Strategic Plan 2024 –2028",
