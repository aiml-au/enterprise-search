However, according to the Strategic Plan 20-28 document, the Orbost Gas Plant, which is related to Cooper Energy's ML project, is located in Victoria. Therefore, a direct answer would be \"No\", but it is indirectly associated with Adelaide through its involvement in a gas processing plant near Adelaide.",

The export sales gas must meet several strict specifications such as t he concentrations of \nsolids particle, water, mercury, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide (H2S).   Two absorber vessels were installed at OGP to remove the H2S concentration of \nuntreated gas. These absorber vessels are designed to run for months/years without any fouling. However, since operating in 2 020 , these vessels \nhave been having fouling issues, which requires each absorber vessel to be opened and mechanically cleaned every 12 – 15 days. \n• Key  questions: What were the differences in operational data that resulted in the two dream runs in Dec 2021? And how do we replicate it for\nthe going -forward operation? This could potentially be answered by the application of ML based on the time series data of pressure, temperature, \nflowrate, injection rate… of the related equipment in the process at OGP. \n• Note: The real -time data at OGP are measured by the local device/gauges then transmitted to the AVEVA PI system for data storage, visualisation and \nsimple analysis. The  AVEVA PI system is very commonly used in industrial operations in Australia and over the world. Therefore, the  quality, format \nand structure of the data are expected to be good quality for machine learning purposes.",
