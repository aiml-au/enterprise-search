We will \npromote social connectivity by making sure our \nstreets are lively and accessible and putting people \nand nature first when we design our public spaces.\nAction on climate change has become more urgent \nand we will support our city to adapt and be climate \nresilient. We will ensure that our residents and visitors \nare prepared, and where possible protected, from hazards such as heatwaves.

We will \nsupport an inclusive, equitable and thriving economy, \nenabling current and emerging businesses to be \ninnovative and globally competitive.\nBy being bold in how we respond to the challenges \nthat will unfold over the coming years, we will create \nnew opportunities that will have a transformative \nimpact on our city, community and businesses.

This Strategic Plan acknowledges \nthat as a capital city council we need to manage our \nresponsibilities to our 26,000 residents and to all 1.7 \nmillion South Australians.\nWe are bold, aspirational \nand innovative.\nBuilt on the traditional lands of the Kaurna people \nwith a rich and deep Aboriginal heritage, Colonel \nLight planned Adelaide in 1837 with an inspired idea: \nan active city centre and an abundance of open space \nwith the River Torrens at its heart. Colonel Light laid \nout the streets surrounded by Park Lands with \nsquares and gardens to create balance in our built \nand natural form. The Park Lands are now nationally \nheritage-listed and are cherished for their beautiful \namenity, array of uses and unique role as a gateway \nto the city.\nOur iconic Adelaide Central Market, Rundle Mall and \nPark Lands provide commercial, social and green \nspaces for people to meet, play and relax.

Our Response\nOver the past decade, we have heard from our \ncommunity that our city must grow if we want to \nthrive, but this growth should not come at the \nexpense of what has made our city one of the most \nliveable in the world.\nTo ensure we maintain our liveability and to support \ngrowth, these principles will underpin everything \nwe do:\n• Exceptional Amenity – Be bold and courageous in \nour pursuit of excellence for our city.\n• Quality Housing – Strive for liveability and \naffordability to attract and retain residents.\n• Community Connection – Strengthen connection, \naccessibility, diversity and inclusivity by putting \npeople first.\n• Unique Experiences – Create interesting \nexperiences for our residents, workers and visitors.\n• Climate Resilience – Embed climate resilience in all \nthat we do.\n• Economic Growth – Encourage innovation, \ninvestment and development in current and \nemerging sectors. \n• Budget Repair – Provide quality services and ensure \nlong-term financial sustainability.\n11 10\nCity of Adelaide | Strategic Plan 2024 –2028",
