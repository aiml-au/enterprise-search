As the Capital City Council for all South \nAustralians, we need to be outward looking, to work \ncollaboratively with Federal, State and Local \nGovernments and to demonstrate excellence, \ninnovation and exceptional service provision.\nThis Plan reflects our commitment to working with \nothers to shape the future of our City for the benefit \nof the whole State. We will continue to build strong \npartnerships to advocate for the benefit of the city \nand leverage our relationships to seek co-investment, \ngrants and contributions to the benefit of our \ncommunity. Key partnerships include those with the \nFederal, State and Local Government sectors, and \nstrategic non-government (private sector, community \ngroups and not-for-profit) organisations.\nIn developing this Plan we have considered our \ndiverse and complex roles and the levers we can use \nto implement and influence change.The City of Adelaide is a:\n• Leader: Developing strategies, policies, programs \nand services that chart a clear course for Adelaide. \n• Owner/Custodian: Managing community assets \nthat are entrusted to Council.\n• Regulator: Undertaking our role under State \nlegislation to keep the city safe, clean and orderly.\n• Information Provider: Providing information about \nCouncil and the city to the general community and \nstakeholders.\n• Advocate: Representing the interests of our \ncommunity to influence issues/opportunities that \nimpact our city.\n• Facilitator/Initiator: Bringing together and \nengaging with individuals, community groups, \nindustry, government agencies and other \nstakeholders to address issues impacting the city.\n• Agent: Providing of services to the community on \nbehalf a third party (e.g. State or Federal \nGovernment) where there is demonstrated need \nand significant benefit to the community.\n• Direct Provider: Delivering our core services, \nprojects or programs.\n• Partner: Working with others to deliver services, \nprograms or projects outcomes. Our Response\nOver the past decade, we have heard from our \ncommunity that our city must grow if we want to \nthrive, but this growth should not come at the \nexpense of what has made our city one of the most \nliveable in the world.\nTo ensure we maintain our liveability and to support \ngrowth, these principles will underpin everything \nwe do:\n• Exceptional Amenity – Be bold and courageous in \nour pursuit of excellence for our city.\n• Quality Housing – Strive for liveability and \naffordability to attract and retain residents.\n• Community Connection – Strengthen connection, \naccessibility, diversity and inclusivity by putting \npeople first.\n• Unique Experiences – Create interesting \nexperiences for our residents, workers and visitors.\n• Climate Resilience – Embed climate resilience in all \nthat we do.\n• Economic Growth – Encourage innovation, \ninvestment and development in current and \nemerging sectors. \n• Budget Repair – Provide quality services and ensure \nlong-term financial sustainability.\n11 10\nCity of Adelaide | Strategic Plan 2024 –2028"
